1. Project Objectives
	The goal of my project is to show that I can create a networked game without a game engine and plugins and without the use of services like Steam or Epic Games. While these are obviously important I have other projects that show I am capable of doing so and I want to show in the purest form my understanding of networking.

2. Tools and Technologies
	SDL2: For the rendering and gameplay of this game I am using SDL2.
3. Scope
	The scope of this project is to create a simple top down 2D shooter where the players can interact with their environment and each other. They will be able to pick up weapons and and fire at each other and these changes will be networked correctly.
	

4. Deliverables
	At the end of this project there will be a playable demo and a short video showcase.
